Pre-requisites:
 * 'make check' passes
 * 'make distcheck' passes
 * Do a test installation and make sure all files are properly dist-ed/install-ed
 * No 'blocker' bugs against the upcoming release in bugzilla


Preparing:
    Pre-releases:
     * Bump nano number up in configure.ac (ex: 0.15.91 -> 0.15.92)
     * Update the dependencies' version numbers in pitivi/check.py
     * Re-autogen
     * Make sure pre-requisites are still valid
     * Commit

    Releases (major or bugfixes):
     * Bump minor number up in configure.ac and remove the nano (ex: 0.15.92 -> 0.16)
     * Re-autogen
     * Make sure pre-requisites are still valid
     * Update the following files:
       * pitivi.org/versions.txt: add new release as current
       * pitivi/check.py: dependencies' version numbers
       * RELEASE: the release notes (or its short version)/announcement. To get the list of contributors, 'git shortlog -s -n RELEASE-<previoustag>..'
       * NEWS: a shorter version of RELEASE, with the exec summary of changes
       * AUTHORS: if there are new maintainers
     * Commit
     * git tag -a RELEASE-X_YY_Z  # For major releases, Z = 0
     * Use git push --tags to ensure the tags are published on the remote
