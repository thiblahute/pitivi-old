0.91 Release "Charming Defects"
-------------------------------
This is the first alpha release for the new version of Pitivi based on GES,
the GStreamer Editing Services library.

It is a major rework of the entire Pitivi architecture. It includes:
- Replacing the core of Pitivi by GES; 20 thousand lines of code removed
- Porting to GStreamer 1.x
- Porting to GTK+ 3.x
- Replacing GooCanvas by Clutter for the timeline
- An automated UI test suite, with many checks for mission-critical parts
- Fixing hundreds of bugs
- Implementing many new features
- UI polish all over the place
- Refactoring pretty much the entire codebase

Since 0.15.2, over 1300 changes have been committed in Pitivi alone.

As you may guess, this gargantuan amount of improvements cannot fit in a short
announcement such as this one. Instead, you can find a more detailed summary on
http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/0.91

Please keep in mind that this is an alpha release, so there may be some bugs we
haven't found yet. We appreciate your feedback, so try it out, let us know how
well it works for you and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter.
With your help, we will follow up with a beta release and eventually a 1.0
release.
